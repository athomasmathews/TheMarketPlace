Hi,

Please run the command "Update-Database" in package manager console 
by selecting the project "Data" as the default project in package manager console.

Also, following implementations are progressing.
- adding servicing layer in between UI and Data layer
- remove inline styling
- standardizing navigation options
- code cleaning and proper naming conventions
- and making few methods asynchronous and its testing.

Thanks,
Ajay
